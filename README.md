# Trinity — Crimson Desert (vTweak by Lian)

Trinity is an in-game DirectX 12 mod menu for **Crimson Desert**, originally created by **XeTrinityz**. This repository contains the current source for the maintained build, including version-dependent game interfaces, auto-navigation, and quality-of-life enhancements.

> **Single-player use only.** Do not use this project in online or anti-cheat-protected modes. This community project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Pearl Abyss.

> **Maintenance status.** A game update can change AOBs, object layouts and hook
> contracts. The source may recognize a revision without every feature having
> been revalidated in the live game. For post-update work, start with
> [GAME_UPDATE_PLAYBOOK.md](GAME_UPDATE_PLAYBOOK.md), then use the exact current
> executable and installed `Trinity.asi` as evidence. Older changelog entries
> describe their release at the time; they are not compatibility claims for a
> later game build.

## What's New in v1.3.3

- **Crimson Desert TU 2.00.02 Hotfix**:
  - Waits for delayed gameplay-code regions before resolving hooks, preventing valid features from being disabled by early startup scans.
  - Scans TU 2.00.02's executable `.debug` section instead of mistaking the live game code for stale debug data.
  - Detects PE revision `1.0.0.2692` as TU 2.00.02.

## Current version-detection baseline

The current source maps PE revisions `2625`, `2658`, `2692` and `2760` to title
updates `2.00.00`, `2.00.01`, `2.00.02` and `2.01.00` respectively. This is a
source-level recognition map, not a blanket live-support promise. Verify the
current executable hash, AOB match counts, hook contracts and the affected
in-game action after every title update.

## What's New in v1.3.2

- **New Combat Feature: Easy Parry (Just Guard)**:
  - Automatically executes Perfect Parry, deflects, and posture break counters on any block against incoming enemy attacks.
- **New Combat Feature: Easy Evade (Just Evade)**:
  - Natively triggers Perfect Dodge with cinematic slow-motion evasion counters during combat maneuvers.
- **New Feature: No Bounty (Crime & Bounty Neutralizer)**:
  - Crimes and theft stop adding bounty penalties, regional fines, or triggering guard pursuit (session-only, save-safe).
  - Preserves full vanilla combat behavior and mortality so NPCs and enemies can still be fought and defeated normally.

- **Universal Table Resolver for TU 2.00.01 (PE rev >= 2625)**:
  - Modernized scanner to detect `sub rsp, 50h` table prologue structures and opcode-relative table globals (`WantedInfo`, `tribeinfo`, `iteminfo`, etc.).
  - Added continuous per-frame upkeep so mod overrides seamlessly persist across fast travel and zone transitions.

## What's New in v1.3.1

- **Critical CTD Fixes & Engine Hardening**:
  - **Fixed NPC Greeting / Interaction Crash (`Trinity.asi+0x19160`)**: Completely replaced inline code patches with SEH-guarded MinHook trampolines and robust pointer validation for quest and transient NPC records.
  - **Fixed Weapon Swapping Race Condition (`CrimsonDesert.exe+0x121F192`)**: Eliminated multi-threaded race conditions between the DirectX 12 render loop and the engine's internal weapon mesh destructor (`ReleaseRef`) by serializing character and equipment scans on the main game thread.
  - **Fixed Character Switching Freeze & Crash**: Resolved deadlocks and crashes occurring when switching between characters (e.g., Damiane ↔ Kliff) after equipment edits via direct actor pointers and SEH exception handlers.
- **Smart Equipped Gear Protection**:
  - Equipping weapons, armor, or accessories no longer falsely registers them as "Sold / Discarded" in the *Restore Lost & Sold Items* menu.
  - Automatically filters actively equipped gear on Kliff, Damiane, and Oongka from the buyback list.
- **Live Self-Healing Item Icons & Side-Panel Tooltips**:
  - Automatically queries the engine's live item definition tables (`IconForTypeId`) to heal corrupted or truncated icon strings from disk history, restoring full high-resolution artwork for all equipment and quest items.
  - Side-panel tooltip preview cards now render reliably for every selected item.
- **Proportional Trust Multiplier Scaling**:
  - Re-engineered trust scaling calculation to provide smooth, proportional progression (1.0x – 100.0x) instead of instant maxing.
- **Native Engine Game Speed Scaling (`hkFrameTimerUpdate`)**:
  - Replaced legacy fixed-timestep overrides with native engine frame timer scaling for smooth 0.1x – 10.0x speed manipulation without FPS drops or physics jitter.

## What's New in v1.3.0

- **Crimson Desert TU 2.00.00 – 2.00.01 Full Support**:
  - Updated memory offsets, structures, and function signatures matching the major Title Update 2.00 overhaul.
  - Re-anchored item reflection tables (`iteminfo`, `ItemGroupInfo`, `stringinfo`, `Inventory`, and `TrItemValue` constructor) for seamless Add Item spawning.
- **Expanded Multi-Language Support (9 Languages)**:
  - Added full native translations for: **English**, **German (Deutsch)**, **Spanish (Español)**, **French (Français)**, **Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)**, **Japanese (日本語)**, **Korean (한국어)**, **Portuguese - Brazil (Português - Brasil)**, **Russian (Русский)**, and **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**.
- **Enhanced Character Resolution**:
  - 3-anchor verification for character manager resolution ensuring 100% reliable player detection across transitions.

## What's New in v1.2.4

- **Smart Lost & Sold Items Tracker (Buyback & Recycle Bin)**:
  - Real-time differential inventory change tracker that automatically logs every item sold to merchants, discarded, or deleted.
  - One-click restoration per item or bulk `>> Restore All Lost & Sold Items <<`.
  - Persistent disk storage (`Trinity_LostItems.txt`) so your buyback history persists across game sessions.
- **Quest & Special Item Catalog Archive**:
  - Dedicated searchable archive for 50+ Bounty Notices, Lore Documents, Recipes, Quest Keys, Relics, and Unique Gear.
- **Universal Backwards Compatibility (TU 1.10 – 1.18+)**: Multi-version adaptive memory layout and dynamic slot strides (`0xC0` for TU <= 1.15, `0xC8` for TU >= 1.16).
- **Runtime Binary Fingerprinting**: Live in-memory machine code scanner to accurately identify and display active Title Updates (e.g. `TU 1.18.02 (Active)`).
- **Cross-Slot Controller Free Flight**: Polling across controller slots 0 through 3 for robust multi-controller and PS5 pad support.
- **Dedicated Submenus**: Integrated **Money & Currency**, **Abyss Items & Artifacts**, and **Restore Items** submenus.
- **Engine Memory Safety Hardening**: Completely eliminated destructive memory writes and wrapped all subsystem refreshes in SEH for 100% crash-free stability.

## What's New in v1.2.3

- **Infinite Mount Stamina TU 1.18+ Fix**: Restored full infinite stamina support for horses, mounts, and dragons while galloping and sprinting.
- **Continuous Stamina & Spirit Auto-Refresh**: Refined stat commit interception so any consumed player or mount stamina and spirit instantly refreshes back to 100% full capacity in real-time.
- **Character Spontaneous Combustion Fix**: Completely purged thermal and elemental debuff meters (types 17, 18, 28, 48) from the scanner, permanently resolving the bug where characters caught fire upon spawn.
- **Native Weather & Environment Controls**: Built-in time of day and weather modifiers under the **WORLD** tab, providing seamless, crash-free environmental control without requiring conflicting external addons.
- **Protagonist Scanning Stability**: Hardened `TickResolveSelf` vital chain validation to eliminate access violation crashes in crowded NPC areas.

## Building from Source

### Requirements:
- Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with **Desktop development with C++**
- Windows 10/11 SDK
- CMake 3.20 or newer

### Build Command:
```powershell
# Configure and build Release x64 binary
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Build_Trinity.ps1
```
The compiled mod will be located at `build/Release/Trinity.asi`.

`Build_Trinity.ps1` also refreshes the build timestamp and assembles release
files. For a compile/test-only maintenance build, use the direct CMake commands
in [GAME_UPDATE_PLAYBOOK.md](GAME_UPDATE_PLAYBOOK.md) instead. Before replacing
an installed ASI, close the game and compare the build and destination SHA-256.
